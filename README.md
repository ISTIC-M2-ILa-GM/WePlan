Weekend Planning Project
GPL v3 - Copyright Gauthier and Gwénolé

This project was created within the ISTIC Rennes school for the TAA and GLI modules.

It corresponds to an activity organizer for weekends. A user must be able to register, log in and configure his account to be able to receive the different events that have been selected by the algorithm. The event generation algorithm takes into account the weather of the locality in question.
